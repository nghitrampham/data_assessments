#### This repo contains all the data take-home assessments I did for interviews at several companies. I was able to proceed to the next round of interviews with all companies. 

Not all notebooks are clean. Clean notebooks/scripts:

1. pocket_gems: retention_model.ipynb + pocket_gem.pdf (better to read the analysis in pocket_gem.pdf first) ~15 hours
2. Luminostics: Luminostics_take_home_assessments.ipynb  ~ 6 hours
3. State farm: features_engineering.ipynb + statefarm_report.pdf  ~ 8 hours
4. Jackson Lewis P.C: data_analysis take home .xlsx file ~ 30 mins
